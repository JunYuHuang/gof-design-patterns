## Basics

- 23 patterns total each under 1 of 3 types
- 3 types / groups of patterns:
  - creational (5)
    - abstract factory
    - factory method
    - builder
    - prototype
    - singleton
  - structural (7)
    - adapter
    - bridge
    - composite
    - decorator
    - facade
    - flyweight
    - proxy
  - behavioral (11)
    - chain of responsibility
    - command
    - interpreter
    - iterator
    - mediator
    - memento
    - observer
    - state
    - strategy
    - template method
    - visitor
- 8 basic patterns
  - abstract factory (C)
  - factory method (C)
  - adapter (S)
  - composite (S)
  - decorator (S)
  - observer (B)
  - strategy (B)
  - template method (B)
- pattern = name + problem + solution + trade-offs
- 2 object-oriented design principles
  - bind to interfaces over implementations
  - composition over inheritance

## Summary Of Patterns

- abstract factory:
  - like having different LEGO block sets for making different parts of a toy castle?
- adapter:
  - like a translator between 2 people who each speak a different language
- bridge:
  - like a switch that links a toy car from unlike remote controls (e.g. button-only, joystick, etc.)
- builder:
  - like a tool for making a complex object step by step from a blueprint
- chain of responsibility:
  - like a few handlers linked sequentially where each handler deals some request or passes it to the next handler
- command:
  - pass requests wrapped in objects between classes
- composite:
  - like being a wizard who creates spells and arranges them into spellbooks
- decorator:
  - like adding extra ingredients to a magical potion to improves its power
- facade:
  - like using a magical key to unlock a complex door to skip solving the puzzle that guards the door
- factory method:
  - like having a magical potion making machine that can create different types of potions
- flyweight:
  - like efficiently creating many similar yet unlike toy soldiers via a magical mold
- interpreter:
  - like having a wizard who can translate and execute commands in a text written in a special language
- iterator:
  - like getting and playing with each toy in a box one by one via a magical wand
- mediator:
  - like a party planner who handles chats and actions between guests at a party
- memento:
  - like saving and restoring progress in a video game via a magical spell
- observer:
  - i.e. pub-sub; like an assistant who watches for changes to an object's state and tells you when those changes occur
- prototype:
  - i.e. clone; like making copies of existing objects via a magic spell and customizing them to make them unique
- proxy:
  - i.e. substitute; like a guardian that controls access to your castle for you
- singleton:
  - like a magical spell applied to a treasure chest so that there is only that one chest in existence at any time
- state:
  - like being a shape-shifter who can turn into unlike animals based on my mood
- strategy:
  - like picking a different character in a video game for each challenge
- template method:
  - like a recipe book with brewing potion instructions that makes it easy to add new potions
- visitor:
  - like being a wizard who interacts with unlike creatures in a forest in a tailored way

## Misc

- abstract factory vs factory method?
  - abstract factory is for multiple factories (that are related)
  - factory method is for 1 factory
- adapter vs bridge?
  - TODO
