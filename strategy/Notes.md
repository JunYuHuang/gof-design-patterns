# Notes

- pattern name: Strategy
- problem:
  - a problem needs different algorithms or ways to solve it
  - the way to solve the problem changes over the problem's life
- solution:
  - Strategy pattern lets a superclass change its method of solving that problem during run time
- trade-offs:
  - pros
    - group related algorithms
    - fill-in for subclassing
    - remove conditionals
    - more usage options
  - cons
    - client code must know different strategies
    - less performant
    - more complexity / code
- misc
  - like picking a unique character in a video game for each challenge
  - prevents forced implementation of superclass-inherited methods in a subclass
  - uses interfaces as supertype / classes for subclasses to inherit and implement with other classes
