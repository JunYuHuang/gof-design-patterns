# Notes

- name: Builder
- problem:
  - want to rid "telescoping constructor" anti-pattern / issue
  - want to make a product with unlike configs
  - want to build Composite trees or complex objects
- solution:
  - lets making complex objects step by step as unlike configs or types via the same maker code
- trade-offs:
  - pros
    - can vary a product's internal guts
    - splits making from portrayal code
    - better control over building action
  - cons
    - more complexity
- misc
  - like a tool for making a complex object step by step from a blueprint
  - splits the responsibility of a class' constructor into another class with separate methods to make the initial class incrementally
  - =
    - product class +
    - product builder interface +
    - concrete product builder class(es) +
    - director class that manages building order / process (optional)
