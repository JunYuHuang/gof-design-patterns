# Chain Of Responsibility

The Chain Of Responsibility pattern allows passing requests thru an ordered line of request handlers. Each handler either processes a request (to break the chain) or passes it to the next handler but not both.

## Quick Start

```bash
# install dependencies
npm i

# build / transpile the TypeScript code into JavaScript
npm run build

# run the code
npm run start

# run the code (TS files) in dev mode
npm run start:dev

# run the tests
npm run test

# run the tests (TS files) in dev mode
npm run test:dev
```
