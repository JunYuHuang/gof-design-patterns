# Notes

- name: Chain Of Responsibility
- problem:
  - need to process unlike requests in varied ways
  - don't know requests' types or order
  - must run handlers in a certain order
- solution:
  - allows passing requests thru an ordered line of request handlers
  - each handler either processes a request and breaks the chain or passes the request to the next handler
- trade-offs:
  - pros
    - less coupling (between request receiver and sender)
    - easier to add more power to objects
    - can set request handling order
  - cons
    - request may be unhandled
- misc
  - like a few handlers linked sequentially where each handler deals some request or passes it to the next handler
  - like traversing thru and stopping at a node in a linked list
  - each handler either processes or passes request to next handler
    - cannot be both
  - each handler in the chain makes 2 decisions
    - process the request or not
    - pass the request to the next handler or not
    - can do both of the above or just one?
  - =
    - handler interface +
    - base handler class (optional) +
    - concrete handler class(es) +
    - request concrete class or primitive value (optional?) +
    - client code
