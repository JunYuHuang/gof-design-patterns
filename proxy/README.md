# Proxy

The Proxy pattern allows making and using a rep object to wrap and control access to another object. The code here is an example of a logging proxy.

## Quick Start

```bash
# install dependencies
npm i

# build / transpile the TypeScript code into JavaScript
npm run build

# run the code
npm run start

# run the code (TS files) in dev mode
npm run start:dev

# run the tests
npm run test

# run the tests (TS files) in dev mode
npm run test:dev
```
