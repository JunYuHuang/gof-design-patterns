# Notes

- name: Proxy
- problem:
  - some object needs to be controlled by another object
  - must limit access to controlled object for some reason e.g. security, performance, speed, etc.
- solution:
  - make a placeholder object that wraps and controls access to the original object
  - the controlled and placeholder object both share the same interface
- trade-offs:
  - pros
    - remote proxies can hide an object's real address space
    - virtual proxies can lift performance e.g. JIT object creation
    - protection proxies and smart references can do side effects on object access
    - can hide control subject / service object from client
    - can manage subject / service life when clients don't care
    - proxy works even if subject / servie is not ready
    - can make new proxies without changing service or client (open-closed)
  - cons
    - more complexity
    - slower response from real subject / service
- misc
  - i.e. substitute; like a guardian that controls access to your castle for you
  - is structurally like a decorator
  - like middleware that wraps and shares the same interface as the real object?
  - many proxy types: e.g. remote, virtual, protection, caching, etc.
  - like a local rep / agent
  - = subject interface + real subject class + proxy class
