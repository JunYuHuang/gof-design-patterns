# Notes

- name: Observer
- problem:
  - many objects need updates and notices from a single source
- solution:
  - Observer pattern makes a subscription system for a source that changes to send updates and notices to its many watchers
- trade-offs:
  - pros
    - loose coupling between subject and observer(s)
    - supports broadcasts
  - cons
    - unexpected updates
- misc
  - like pub-sub but not exactly
  - pub-sub vs observer pattern?
    - same
      - communication between objects
      - loose coupling
      - notice tool
    - pub-sub
      - many-to-many
      - more control over notices
      - flexible and scalable
      - subs and pubs don't know each other
      - subs and pubs chat via a middleman / broker
    - observer
      - 1-to-many
      - few control over notices
      - simpler and more direct
      - observers know the subjects
      - subject keeps a list of observers
