# Notes

- name: Adapter
- problem:
  - need an existing class but can't work with it (via its interface) directly
- solution:
  - create a middle man translator layer that makes some existing class (the service) usable by other code (the client)
- trade-offs (object adapters):
  - pros
    - single responsibility
    - open-closed; adapter can easily add new features to all adaptees (adaptee itself and its subclasses)
  - cons
    - more complexity
    - harder to override adaptee behaviour (compared to class adapters)
- misc
  - two adapter types: class adapters and object adapters
  - class vs object adapters:
    - class adapters
      - needs multiple (class) inheritance support
      - inherits / subclasses BOTH the client AND adaptee classes
      - more complex
    - object adapters
      - implements 1 interface or inherits from the 1 client class
      - more simple
