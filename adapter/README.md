# Adapter

The Adapter pattern is a middle man layer that lets objects or classes that are directly not compatible work with each other. The code in this project is an example of an object adapter.

## Quick Start

```bash
# install dependencies
npm i

# build / transpile the TypeScript code into JavaScript
npm run build

# run the code
npm run start

# run the code (TS files) in dev mode
npm run start:dev

# run the tests
npm run test

# run the tests (TS files) in dev mode
npm run test:dev
```
