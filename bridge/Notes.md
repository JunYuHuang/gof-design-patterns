# Notes

- name: Bridge
- problem:
  - want to split a monolithic class with feature variants
  - must extend a class in many indie aspects
  - must switch working guts at runtime
- solution:
  - splits an interface from its working guts so they can each differ separately
- trade-offs:
  - pros
    - splits interface from working internals or implementation
    - more extensible
    - hides working guts from client code
  - cons
    - more complexity
- misc
  - like a switch that links a toy car to unlike remote controls (e.g. button-only, joystick, etc.)
  - like facade + remote proxy
  - bridge vs adapter
    - both
      - point at existing type / object
    - bridge
      - define both the interface and working means / internals
      - can set implementation at runtime
    - adapter
      - define only the interface
      - can NOT set implementation at runtime
  - interface and internals often have unlike interfaces
  - splits interface from working means
  - =
    - abstraction class +
    - implementation interface +
    - concrete implementations +
    - abstraction concrete subclass (optional)
  - abstraction object references implementation object
  - abstraction class has high level methods
  - concrete implementations have low level methods
