# Notes

- name: Prototype
- problem:
  - code will not rely on concrete classes of objects to copy
  - want fewer subclasses that vary only in how they first create their objects
  - don't want a deeply nested rank of class factories
- solution:
  - allows copying present objects while the code does not rely on their classes
- trade-offs:
  - pros
    - can clone objects without coupling to concrete classes
    - easy to create new objects
    - create new objects by changing structure
    - less subclasses
  - cons
    - tricky to clone complex (subclass) objects
- misc
  - i.e. clone; like making copies of existing objects via a magic spell and customizing them to make them unique
  - TLDR: add a `clone()` method to a class
  - structure =
    - prototype interface / abstract class +
    - concrete prototype class(es) +
    - client code
  - prototype interface / abstract class has `clone()` method
  - `clone()` method is like a facade for the class constructor
