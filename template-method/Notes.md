# Notes

- name: Template Method
- problem:
  - an algorithm has some parts that always works the same way and other parts that can be left for the algorithm's subclasses to do
  - common behaviour from subclasses can be factored out into a common super class
  - such subclasses may do extra stuff
- solution:
  - set the base algorithm in an super class' method while letting subclasses define some steps
  - keeps an algorithm's structure or order the same while letting some of its steps to be changed or set by subclasses
- trade-offs:
  - pros
    - inverted control
    - lets its subclasses / client code override only certain steps of the template method
    - reduces duplicate code
  - cons
    - may limit some subclasses
    - may violate Liskov Substitution principle
    - hard to maintain with more steps
- misc
  - like a recipe book with brewing potion instructions that makes it easy to add new potions
  - AKA abstract class + inheritance variant
  - abstract class with
    - abstract methods
    - template concrete method(s) that each
      - call the abstract methods in some order
      - may call hooks as part of the order
      - cannot be overridden by its concrete subclasses
    - or without hooks
    - hooks: concrete methods each with some preset behaviour
      - does nothing by default
      - overridable by its concrete subclasses
      - follows Hollywood principle: "Don't call us, we'll call you"
