# Notes

- name: Abstract Factory
- problem:
  - need 1 place to make sets of related objects
  - don't want list the objects' concrete classes
- solution:
  - use 1 interface to create sets of related objects without listing their classes
- trade-offs:
  - pros
    - sets concrete classes apart
    - makes switching product sets easy
    - supports consistency among products (i.e. compatibility)
  - cons
    - hard to support new product types
    - more complexity / code
- misc
  - AKA kit
